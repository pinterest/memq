# MemQ: An efficient, scalable cloud native PubSub system

MemQ is a new PubSub system that augments Kafka at Pinterest. It uses a decoupled storage and serving architecture similar to Apache Pulsar and Facebook Logdevice; however, it relies on a pluggable replicated storage layer i.e. Object Store / DFS / NFS for storing data. The net result is a PubSub system that:

- Handles GB/s traffic
- Independently scales, writes, and reads
- Doesnâ€™t require expensive rebalancing to handle traffic growth
- Is 90% more cost effective than our Kafka footprint
